# sign-up-form (a project for the Odin Project)

Sign-up Form for a made-up service using HTML, CSS

Things That I've Learnt:
1. Using css property object fit with value of cover to place an image within a container and fills this parent container without losing aspect ratio.
Other values to the css property: fill, contain

2. Using overflow property on a div and setting different values such as auto and hidden for specific axes of x and y
